A quick rundown of CSS.
--------------------------

CSS (short for cascading style sheets) is a way to change the placement and appearance of items in your document. In comes in two parts: a **selector** that selects what element (or elements) you want to style, and a the **styles** which are a series of name-value pairs that specify style properties and the values you wish to set those styles to.

{% highlight css %}
selector {
 property: value;
}
{% endhighlight %}



Box model
-----------------------

Technically there's a lot more going on about the box model with css. But, for this class, just keep in mind that *all elements on the screen take up a certain, box shape*/

By default, divs will take up an entire row of the screen and push subsequent elements beneath them.

Where to put your stylesheet
--------------------------

You can either put them into an external .css file and link them to your project with a `<link href="tyles.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />`

Or you can write your styles inside of a set of `<style>` tags in your html document.

Selectors
--------------------------

There are three major ways to select elements to be styled.

1. Via the tag names.

{% highlight css %}
/* apply this style to all pagraph tags */
 p {

 }

/* apply this style to all header ones */
 h1 {

 }
{% endhighlight %}

2. Via class names (use a . before the name to specify you're select a class)

{% highlight css %}
	/* any element with class='diglet' will have this style applied to it*/
	.diglet {

	}
{% endhighlight %}

3. Via IDs (a a # before the name to specify you're selecting an element with an ID)

{% highlight css %}
	/* the element with id='highlander' will have this style applied to it*/
	#highlander {

	}
{% endhighlight %}


Subselection
--------------------------

You can further refine your selections by selecting sub elements of the first matched element

{% highlight css %}
	/* this will select all elements of class of diglet, contained within an element with an ID of highlander*/
	#highlander .diglet {

	}
{% endhighlight %}


Actually styling
----------------------------

The second part of a stylesheet is the series of names and values to set those properties to.

Some major ones will will be dealing with in this class:

- height (make sure to put 'px' after the size)
- width (make sure to put 'px' after the size)
- color (which is the color of the text)
- background-color (the.. color of the background)
- top ( the upper corner position of the box)
- left ( the upper-corner position of the box)
- position (if we have control over it, or the layout engine does)
- opacity (how visible / see through something is)


Height and width
------------------------

- Sets the height and width of an element

{% highlight css %}
	#highlander {
		height: 100px;
		width: 200px;
	}
{% endhighlight %}

color
---------------

- Sets the color of the text inside of an object
- Takes a hex color value

{% highlight css %}
	#highlander {
		color: #00FF00;
	}
{% endhighlight %}

background-color
------------------

- Sets the background color of the box the element takes up on the screen
- Takes a hex color value

{% highlight css %}

	#highlander {
		background-color: #00FF00;
	}
{% endhighlight %}

Opacity
-------------------

- How visible the element's box is
- Goes from 0 (not visible) to 1 (fully visible)

{% highlight css %}

	#highlander {
		opacity: .7;
	}
{% endhighlight %}

Position
-----------------

- By default the web browser lays out your design and forces your elements into certain positions
- if you want to control exactly where your element is positioned, you need to set it to absoulte.
- Once you do, you can position it on the x and y axes using the left and right properties

{% highlight css %}

	/* sets a box to always be at pixel position 100, 100 */
	#highlander {
		position: absolute;
		top: 100px;
		left: 100px;
	}
{% endhighlight %}
