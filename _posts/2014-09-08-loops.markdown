Loops
----------------------

Are a way of doing the same thing, multiple times.

For loop
----------------------

{% highlight javascript %}
//This particular loop will run five times
//Its cool like that
for(var i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
	console.log(i);
}
{% endhighlight %}

For loops have three parts inside their parens

	1. Create a variable (called an **iterand** when used in looping, and often named 'i'), and sets it to a value (usually '0')
	2. A logical test. **The moment the test returns false, the loop halts**
		- This test is run every time before the loop is executed
	3. A statement to run when the loop has completed. (Usually adds one to the **iterand**)

The other half of the loop is the block that comes after it. This is the code that is run for every **iteration** (or loop). In the example above, its everything inside the curly brackets, so we're just outputting to the console what the value of *i* is for that loop.

Some others.

{% highlight javascript %}
//runs seven times
for(var i = 0; i < 7; i++)
{
	console.log(i);
}

//runs 100 times
for(var i = 0; i < 100; i++)
{
	console.log(i);
}
{% endhighlight %}


While loop
--------------------------

Is just the logical portion of the for loop.

Here's a while loop, rewritten

{% highlight javascript %}
var i = 0;
while(i < 5)
{
	console.log(i);
	i++;
}
{% endhighlight %}


Here's a fun one:

{% highlight javascript %}
while(true)
{

}
{% endhighlight %}

The break statement
-----------------------------

Let's say you did what you need to do in a loop, but its still running.

You can **break** out of it.

{% highlight javascript %}
//this loop will only run 5 times
for(var i = 0; i<10; i++) {
	if(i>4) {
		break;
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}
